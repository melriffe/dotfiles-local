## Dotfiles Local

This repository is a compliment to the Dotfiles repository. It contains 'local' versions that can be included.

### Management

I'm using Thoughtbot's `rcm` to manage my dotfiles. Because I'm using Neovim, I'm ignoring all of their `vim` configuration files. Additionally, because I'm using the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` for the location of my `tmux.conf` files, I'm ignoring their `tmux` files as well.
